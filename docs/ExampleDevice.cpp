    /*
    The variable name is what the end user will use to configure that variable. For instance, EX-FIRST=5 to set the firstValue
    variable to a value of 5. The value will be constrained between the min and max values and will not be updated unless
    it falls within the allowable range. There are many variable types. You need to make sure the variable type you specify
    properly matches the actual variable you have passed in. If you are using a float number (can store numbers that aren't integer)
    then the # of decimal places can be specified as well. This is ignored for integers. Finally, the real mystery is that
    function pointer you can pass at the end. If your variables mean something discrete you can use this function to turn 
    those values into some text. In the example above we specify that our describeFirstVar function should be used for this.
    Below you will find that function. The function must return String and has no parameters. Instead it operates directly
    on the object's members so each individual ConfigEntry that you want to describe needs a separate function to describe it.
    Most ConfigEntry's probably don't need this functionality so nullptr is acceptable most of the time.
