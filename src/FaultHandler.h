/*
 * FaultHandler.h
 *
 * Creates a universal fault handling system that stores faults in EEPROM and can create, return, and clear
 * fault data. Could be the basis for an OBDII compliant fault database or could be used on its own
 *
 * Technically, one can't clear or erase faults. They get acknowledged and quit showing up
