Notes on GEVCU7 conversion. This is somewhat a stream of consciousness but covers
the state of the code and where I plan to take it.


Quite far into the conversion process. it compiles
now and most stuff should work. There have been two prototypes so far. The first
one wasn't so good but the second is useable with minor hardware fixes. Then we made
a third revision which is what is current. This revision does not have any required
board level bodges to get it working. The one remaining thing is that some voltage
bleeds through the 5V regulator and turns on the 12v light but a little bit dimly.


Both the onboard ESP32 and the MicroMod adapter itself can be updated
via files on the sdcard. 


The board now presents as two serial ports. The first one is the standard
serial console where settings can be changed. The second port is a GVRET compatible
binary protocol port for use with SavvyCAN. This port will forward all traffic on
all three buses to SavvyCAN for debugging and analysis. It should be possible to
send traffic down any of the three buses from SavvyCAN as well.

I'm considering dropping the secord serial port and consolidating that functionality
to the first one on a trigger (probably 0xE7 like what puts GVRET into binary mode)
as character 0xE7 should not normally be sent by text traffic. This gives room to
set up as "MTP + Serial" which would allow for accessing the SDCard over USB without having
to remove it. However, while testing has shown that this can work, it seems kind of touchy,
the files get returned a little corrupted (maybe?) and changes won't really show up properly.
It might be interesting but it seems to have its fair share of problems.
 

D0 in documentation is Teensy Pin 4 and is connected to DIG_INT (interrupt from 16 way I/O expander)
D1 in documentation is Teensy Pin 5 and is connected to SD_DET (detect SD card is inserted when line is low)


I'm thinking to convert the tick interface to instead run each device as a thread using TeensyThreads which comes
with the TeensyDuino install. These threads can then be preempted if necessary which keeps device latency more 
predictable as then no device can tie up the system for too long. But, threads are only going to really work with
normal functions not member functions of classes. This might still work if the TickHandler class has a trampoline 
function that takes a pointer to an object whose class derives from Device. Then the handleTick function can be called 
appropriately. This would necessitate that actually there be a function (still not in a class) that does nothing but 
wait for a specific amount of time then calls handleTick. Likewise, the message passing could be done this same basic 
way by having a function that spins waiting for a message then dispatches it. But, TeensyThreads doesn't really 
support that so it may be a poor choice.

Another advantage of this idea is the ability for the system to have more threads that monitor things,
do logging, etc. But, having multiple threads that can preempt means that a lot of things would need to be thread safe
which currently are not. So, this might be a pretty big and daunting change to make. But, generally an ECU will run
an RTOS (real time operating system) for the explicit reason that it tends to be necessary to have dependable timing
constraints for things in an ECU. So, don't discount this idea just yet. It may be something that happens. If it does
happen it'll be mostly transparent to the actual drivers so nobody should have to worry about this except for me.

The currently existing scheme is basically cooperative multi-tasking as there's a timer tick queue and it is 
dispatched in order and so devices get callbacks at interval and CAN data can more or less be immediately
sent to the CAN handler for a given device. There also is already existing a message passing system. Nothing
in the whole system has any sort of sychronization but since most everything is cooperatively tasked
that may be OK. Even the CAN messages are really only dispatched by the events calls in the main loop. So, really
nothing that a device driver would do should ever step on other code. It's a bit "icky" that everything is
cooperatively tasked but we're talking about a 600MHz processor running pretty basic code. Your device driver should
not be taking that many cycles. The only thing to really watch out for is to never use wait loops like the "delay"
function. Don't delay for 500ms, come back later. 


There should be a way for the system to signal it wants to shut down and either stay down or reboot. In those cases,
it should be possible for devices to render things safe. For instance, a motor controller driver would probably
want to set the gear to neutral or park (as applicable. Obviously don't go into park when going 80MPH), a BMS
might want to open contactors safely, etc. But, there is some level of priority here. First off, the inverter
should shut down and quit trying to draw or source current. Also, DC/DC should stop working, then when as much
current as possible is stopped we can open contactors. Then settings can be saved to EEPROM. But, this also brings
up the question of shutdown type. Turning the key off is much different from crashing into a propane truck.
This can also pave the way for allowing GEVCU7 to be on constantly and control the rest of the system intelligently.
If it's always on then it could do safe shutdown then sleep and wake up when the key is turned back to on.
But, what sort of sleep current could the board get to? It can turn off the ESP32 and the digital I/O chip doesn't
really take much power. The CAN tranceivers will not turn off. Testing seems to suggest it can idle around 40ma
and running it is 100ma or more. If a normal car battery is about 40ah then a 40ma draw will drain the battery
dead in 1000 hours or about 41 days. It's probably not ideal to leave GEVCU7 running but still some support should
exist because it overlaps with the need to safety shut down for other reasons.

To support the above, it would be necessary to wire GEVCU7 to a dedicated power wire that always has power and then
designate a different digital input pin to be the key on signal. When key is on we turn on everything we can and enable
the system. When the key is turned off we ask everyone to stop what they're doing, save EEPROM, and go into the lowest power
mode possible. But, this would probably require that GEVCU could also control a contactor or something to actually cut 12V power
to the rest of the car. Then you're hoping that GEVCU7 is stable enough to really be controlling the power for the whole car.
Otherwise nothing works at all. Though, if GEVCU7 dies nothing is really going to work that great in any event. If it is
controlling the inverter then you aren't going unless it's working. So, this might be viable. 


It is now possible to dump and load the entire EEPROM to/from SDCard. It's also possible to get both directions
in JSON instead. This is much easier to work with.

/*
Here lies where the old "createObjects" function was. There is no need for that.
Now each device driver that should be registered to the system instead just 
creates an object for itself at the end of the CPP file. The creation of that
object registers it with the system automatically. This also allows selective
compilation. If you don't want a specific device driver, just don't compile and
link it. If you want secret device drivers just don't push them into public source
repositories. Now drivers are basically self contained.
NOTE: This means that the preference handler should not be initialized until
the setup() method and that the device manager must be already instantiated
when the devices try to register. Hopefully this happens but if not it might
be necessary to switch the device handler to a singleton and have it automatically
create itself on first access.
So far, so good. It seems this functionality is working properly.
